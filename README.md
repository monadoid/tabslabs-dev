# TabsLabs.dev static site

A minimal static Hello World site with `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js` ready for deployment on Cloudflare Pages.

## Deploy
Cloudflare Pages can be pointed at this repository with the default build settings: build command (leave empty) and publish directory set to `/` because it is a static directory-root site.
